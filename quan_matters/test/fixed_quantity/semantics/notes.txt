in dimless_divide.cpp test_rt_negative_integer_exp_2div is failing to compile due static_assert . probably range
Uses external stuff. Should probably try to find internal stuff to use.. Needs looking at. Currently commented out.
May be due to rational value out of range

may be quan/detail/pow10_exponent required here

udt_value_type not working
