Breaking change to <quan/uav/get_distance.hpp>
added a template parameter for return lengthtype. Was previously being returned in mm
, but felt that was inappropriate. Now can be used to return in any units.

Changed implementation of <quan/uav/get_bearing.hpp>
 Original impl didnt seem to work unless involved very large distances.
